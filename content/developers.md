### Source Code

Source code relevant to SharedHealth is in GitHub under the [Shared Health](http://github.com/sharedhealth) project. 

Most of us work on a vagrant VM. A detailed guide to set up a machine is in the works. In general, you can download a CentOS box and then use relevant Vagrant scripts to provision.  

We are also writing ansible scripts and playbooks to provision automatic setup and deployment of entire SharedHealth HIE system with Bahmni and OpenMRS. Please have a look at the [FreeSHR Playbooks](https://github.com/SharedHealth/FreeSHR-Playbooks) and [FreeSHR-SCM](https://github.com/SharedHealth/FreeSHR-SCM) 

Current packages can be downloaded from our CI server.

Note: There might be a few rough edges to be smoothened out during the setup. Please contact us via our mailing lists if you are interested in setting this up.
