    Shared Health is an endeavour to create a Health Information Exchange (HIE), in mode of <a href="http://ohie.org">OpenHIE</a>, targeting low resource settings. It intends to make exchange of health information across systems possible. 
    <br/>

    This pilot project is aimed towards establishing HIE in Bangladesh, supported by Director General of Health Services, MoHFW Bangladesh. Like OpenHIE, the setup will consist of multiple components, interacting and interoperating with each other over standard and agreed protocols and contracts. 

    <br/>

    We hope through this effort, Bangladesh will be able to provide accessible and quality healthcare at "Points of Care" facilities, and the centralized Shared Health will support in decision making and improvement of health services across the Nation.
